  <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
  <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
  <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>Who said—“Two vast and trunk less legs of stone<br/>
    Stand in the desert....Near them,on the sand,<br/>Half sunk as hattered v is age lies,whose frown,<br/>
    And wrinkled lip,and sneer of cold command,<br/>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
    Which yet survive,stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>The hand that mocked them,and the heart that fed;<br/>
    And on the pedestal,these words appear:<br/>My name is Ozymandias,KingofKings;<br/>
    Look onmy Works,ye Mighty,anddespair!<br/>Nothing beside remains.Round the decay<br/>
    Of that colossal Wreck,boundless and bare<br/>The lone and levels and sstretch far away.”<br/></p>
